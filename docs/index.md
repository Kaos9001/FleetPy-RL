Welcome to the **FleetSim** project! 😍 We offer a framework for fleet simulation. On this page, you could have a brief overview of this framework.

## Features

* Agent-based simulations of dynamic vehicle routing problems

* Time- and event-based interaction models with requests

* Simulation contains information flow, i.e. request – offer – accept/reject

* Various request-acceptance models, e.g. ‘always accept’, ‘accept if hard constraints are satisfied’, ‘probabilistic sensitivity on offer parameters’, or even ‘probabilistic based on mode-choice model’ that considers also other mode alternatives

* Several fleet control strategies to assign requests, pool and assign requests, reposition vehicles, re-charge electric vehicles

* Modular approach enables combination of different request models, network representations, fleet control strategies

## Installation
